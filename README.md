# HTML-AND-CSS-PROJECTS
This repository contains my HTML and CSS projects.

## Projects
-One Page Site
-Academy Cinemas Site
-Simple Recipes Site
-Pet Shop Site

### One Page Site
This page was one of my first projects created with HTML and CSS. In this project I created a page about game categories I'm passionate about. 
Using CSS I styled my font, font-size, form, and in the HTML file I set the size of the images and video displayed.

### Academy Cinemas Site
This site is a test page styled with Bootstrap. On this page I used many Bootstrap components (e.g. navbar, form cards, and dropdowns).

### Simple Recipe Site
This page was created using HTML and CSS. This site is a detailed page for recipes made with columns. 
Using CSS I styled the colors, fonts, added a dropdown for the recipes in the navbar, 
and made the effect where you can hover over the pictures of the recipes and they flip over showing the prep time, and the difficulty to make it.

### Pet Shop Site
This page is a demo of a pet shop site containing multiple types of animals (e.g. dogs, cats, rabbits, and reptiles).
The site has CSS styling such as a checkered background. The navbar includes links to all animals, home page, and dedicated contact page.
